#  Task 1
 ### Week 1 

 We write a C program that adds numbers from 1 to 'n'.
* We first installed the leafpad editor if it was not previously installed.
* Then we write down our C code in the editor and save it as {filename.c} file.

### Code

```
# include <stdio.h.>

int main() {
    int i, sum= 0, n= 5;
    for (i=o; i<=n; ++i) {
    sum +=i;
    }
    printf("Sum of the numbers from 1 to %d is %d\n", n,sum);
    return 0;
}
```

* After saving the file we write down the command
` gcc {filename.c} `
` ./a.out`

Then we can play with the numbers to get different outputs.

* We write another command and run it.
` riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o {filename}.o {filename}.c`

* We go to another tab and see the assembly code of the program

`riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d {filename}.o`

* Then we type another command

  ` riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d {filename}.o | less `

This will give us the section of the code but we require only the main section.
* Then we locate the byte address of the main section.

## Finding the number of instructions

* We add the last instruction with 4 to get the next address.
  As it is byte instructions it always increments by 4.

( The last institution is highlighted in blue)



### To count the number of instructions

* The first instruction is subtracted from the first instruction of the previous address and then divided by 4.

Then we get the number of instructions in the DEC section.



* We run the same command but instead of `O1`  we use
  ` Ofast `
  ` riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o {filename}.o {filename}.c`

  * We run the same command and search for the main again
  * Then we again calculate the number of instructions.

### Code

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

int i,sum=0,n=5;

for(i=0;i<=n;i++){

sum+=i;

}

printf("sum of numbers from 1 to %d is: %d\n",n,sum);

}
```
